xvi PREFACE.

The Isson Rom of the Exchequer, which were also
made in triplicate, appear to be the Treasurer and Cham-
berlains’ account of money actually issued pursuant to
the Writ of Liberata directed to them. They contain
entrieS, however, which are neither on the Chaucery
nor on the Exchequer Liberale Roll: for instance, pay-
ments made by authority of Letters of Privy Seal and
Writs Current occur on the Issue Roll, but which are not
on the Liberate Rons. It may be proper to observe,
that occasionally the triplicate Issue Rolls differ from
each other, or rather there are more entries on the one
than on the otherg the cause of which it is ,at the dis-
tance of time difficult to explain. The entry relative to
the same payment on the Chaucery and Exchequer Libe-
rate Rons, and on the Issue Roll, has been selected in the
above example, to show in what respect the entries vary,
and how much fuller they are on the Liberate than, on ·

the Issue Rolls.

it expresses taxes and tallages, and also the honorary gifts or customary
presente which were anciently made by the Welch to every new King
and Prince of walae. The tribute paid by the inhabitants of the pala-
tinate of Chester to each new earl was also termed Misoe. It is enacted,
in the statute 27 Hen. VIII. c. 23„ “ that the Lords Marchers shall have
“ all such misen and profits os their tenants aa they have had or used to

Misae to be ‘⁸ money given by way of contract to purchase liberties,” διο.
