Eumms on the· Lmnmrn Rom during the nmen of
ch J orm.

’ The *LmnnA'rn Rous of the reign of King John
contain entries precisely similar to those which occur
on the Cnosn Roas. The two series of records were

· then in fact identical ¹, and the Close Rolls com-

mence when the Liberate Rolls of that reign terminate.
From the 6th year of King John to the 9th of King
Hem-y the Third inclusive there are not any Liberate
Reus, but the Writs of that description during that

period are enrolled among the other Writs on the Close
Rons.

The Liberate Rolls recommence in the lOth year of
King Henry the Third, and continue to the 14th year of
King Henry the -Sixth, aster which time no Roll of that
description seems to have been made up. The few Writs
of Liberam, Allocate, and Computate, which issued aster
that period under the Great Seal, are enrolled among the

other Writs on the Close Rolls.

¹ The Libet-ate Rou of the 5th and the Close Roll of the 6th year have
nearly the same tides, from which it may be infern-ed that orIginally the
two series of Reus were considered as the same. The present classifi-
cation of the Chaucery Records is as ancient aa the reign of King Richard
the Second.
