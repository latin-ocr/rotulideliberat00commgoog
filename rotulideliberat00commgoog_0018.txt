tered on those of the Exchequer¹ of the same year. The
latter Record contains only those Writs that were dis-
charged in each year, and therefore does not include all
which were issued. It should however be stated that
the Exchequer Rolls contain a few entries not on the
Chaucery Bon, such as payments connected with the ex-
penses and salaries of the Officers of the Receipt of the
Exchequer‚ for which 'the precept of the Treasurer was
alone required, so that the authority of the Great Seal
of England not being required, no Entry thereos could
appear on the Chaucery Roll.

The Exchequer Liberate Rolls were made in triplicaoe3
—one by the Treasurer‚ and one by each of the two
Chamberlains: they differ slightly in form though not in
substance from the Chancery Roll, as may bc seen by
specimens of the two Rolls.

¹ The Exchequer Rolls contain the record of Writs which were issued
in several years3 those of the Chaucery are confined to the write of one

year only.
