PRAESTITA ROLL.

On the PnAEsn‘rA Rom, so called from the word proesti-
tum, were entered the sums of money which issued out of
any of the Royal Treasuries byway of imprest¹, advanoe,
or accommodation.

The only Roll of this description among the muniments
in the Tower is that of the 12th year of the reign of King
John, printed in this volume3 but among the Records
lately in the custody of the King’s Remembrancer, and
now deposited‘ at the Carlton Ride Record Office, there
are two others bearing the same title 3 one of the 7 th and
the other of the l4th, l5th, and 16th years of the same
reign. The Roll of the seventh year has also been lately
printed in 'the volume entitled “ Selections from the

Miscellaneous Records of the Office of the King’s Remem-
brancer of the Exchequer.”

Though the eutries on the Praestita Roll, when com-
pared with the other Records printed in the volume, are

1 The prese or impr-est was in the nature of a concreditum ,- and when
a man had money imprested to him, he immediately became accountable
for the same to the Crown,; for instance, it appears by the Liberate
Roll, 21 Hen.111.' m. 9., that the Countess of Pembroke‚ the King's
sister, had 1001. de proestito, which she accounted for at the Exchequer.
The citizens of London paid into the Excheqner 200 marka, “ de praestito
eis facco ad civitatem suam claudendam.” On the Praestita Rou now
printed are several notiees of money advaneed to individuals; and the
entries are cancelled because the parties had repaid it. Thus, Roland Bloet'
had one mark, “ de praestito‚” and the entry is cancelled “ quia reddidit ,·”
Warin Fitz Gerold had 5⁸. of the King for play, the enti-y is cancelled
“ quia solvit ,·” Peter Fitz Hei-bert had 201„ the entry is cancelled “ quia
solvit in cantem apud Odilmm.”
