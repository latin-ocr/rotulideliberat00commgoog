PREFACE. xvii

first, deposited in the Tower, is printed in this volume;
the other ¹, formerly in the Office of the King‘s Remem-
brancer, but now among the muniments at Carlton Ride‚
has been lately printed, with a selection of other records
from that repository.²

Τὴε M1sAE Rom here printed contains an account of
the daily expenses of the Court of King John, during the
eleventh year of his reign. It gives those minute details
which reveal so much of the spirit, munnere„ and customs
of the age, both public and private, and which are sought
for in vain in the chronicles and writings of HistorianS.
This Record throws considerable light upon the trade of
that period; the value of gold, silver, j ewellery, and arms;
the prices of robes», dresseS, wineS, provision8‚ and the
various other articles used in domestic economy; the
presents made to distinguished individuals; the salaries
and pensions to the Officers of State and others in the
Royal household; the expenses of Ambassadors and
Messengers; the money bestowed in alms and oblations ς
all of which were regisissered on the Misae Roll with
scrupulous exactneSS.

The value of this Record is increased by its being
the only one of the series of Chaucery Rolls of that year
which has escaped the ravages of time and civil war.

¹ A duplicate of that Roll is at the Chapter House.
² SelectIons from the Miscellaneam Records of the Exchequer. Edited
by Mr. Hem-y Cole.
