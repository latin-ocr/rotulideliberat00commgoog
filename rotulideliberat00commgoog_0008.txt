1 'The Cheet, with three different looks, containing the Royal treasure
was under the care of the Treaeurer and the two chamberlaine of the Ex-

stu-ap, upon which the Treasurer affixed his seal after the locks were
fastened, so that nothing could be taken out without the consent
of those three Officers. Hence it is that Writs of Liberate were
addressed to them.
