Enrnms on the Lmnnun Roms during the REtGN of
King HENRY ‘run Tuum.

The entries on the Liberate Rous during the reign of
King Henry the Third abound in materials for the illus-
tration of History, and furnish many interesting details
of the Royal expenditure. They supply the desideratum
between the Mm: R0Lm¹ of the reign of King John and

. the Wardrobe Accounts of the reign of King Edward

 

the First, records which are now universally admitted
to conta'in the most valuable information on all subjecte
connected with the rise and progress of the arte, com-2
merce, and manufactures of the Realm.

These Rolls during the time of King Henry the Third

are not, as in some subsequent reigns, confined to Writs
of Liberate, but contain others of a similar character,
technically called Writs of “ALLocA'm ’⁹ and ‘⁶ COMPUTAm.” -
They also issued ont of Chancery‚ and were addressed
to the Barons of the Exchequer, commanding them to
f compute with and allow to accountants and debtors
⁰ such sums of money as they had paid away pursuant
to the King’s written mandate to them directed3 thus,
“Writs and Warrants of Liberata were addressed to the
Treasurer and· Chamberlains who had the charge of

Royal cofferS, and those of Allocate and Computa-te to the

Barons whose office it was to audit and check the Royal
AccountS.
