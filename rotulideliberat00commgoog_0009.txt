made such a statement if he had been acquainted with
the formula of the Writs in question. The instances he
cites from the Registrum Brevium¹ certainly do not
contain the word liberate, but those examples are not in
the form of the regular Writ which had been in use from
the reign of Kin g Hem-y· the Second ², and continued to
that of King William the Fourth‚ and from which the
Liberate Rolls derive their name. Those to which he

refers were Writs issued upon grants of annual payments ι
or salai-ies by Letters Patent, and would be more properly
called Writs of “ solvatis?

in the year 1837 for the Master of the Rolls. During many years pre·
vionsly the Writ for the Mastei· of the Rolls was the only one that was
issued under that Seal. The Ushdr of the Exchequer also receives certain
payments by virtue of a ‘⁴ Liberate’· under the Exchequer Seal; the last
is that of Hilary Term1844. The Writ is addressed in the Queen’s
name to the Comptroller os the Exchequer only.
